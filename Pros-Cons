It was challenging to complete so many assignments at once but I found that I was better with the next assignment after having done the one previous. 

There was some of the time where I had to reference past material that I had learned weeks ago and it was a good refresher and it was not very difficult finding the correct lecture.

I did not completely remember certain things like:
  *Publishing from github
  *testing in console
  
I also could not sync my github with the sublime text editor properly so I was copying a lot of my work over from sublime to github.
